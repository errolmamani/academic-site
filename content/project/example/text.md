Social media platforms and technology companies have been investing heavily in ways to cope with this offensive language to prevent abusive behavior in social media. Waseem and Hovy (2016) One of the first action for tackling this problem is use computational methods to identify aggression and hate speech in user-generated content. This topic has attracted significant attention in recent years as evidenced in recent publications (Waseem et al. 2017; Davidson et al. 2017;Kumar et al. 2018).
